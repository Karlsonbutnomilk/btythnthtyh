    <h1 class="heading">Bullying Poem</h1>
    
    <p id="poem"> 
    
    Somewhere deep inside of you<br>
    there's a kinder, softer place<br>
    I know this may suprise you-<br>
    but I've seen it in your face.<br>
    Your eyes are often sad, although<br>
    you wear a surly grin.<br>
    Sometimes when you stand all alone<br>
    your 'mean' seems to worn and thin.<br>
    I wish that you would take a step-<br>
    a small one, but a brave one too-<br>
    and look inside yourself to find<br>
    the good I see in you.
